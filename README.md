# Password Checker

This Python script allows you to check if a password has been compromised in data breaches by querying the "Have I Been Pwned" API. It provides a count of how many times the password has appeared in known breaches. If a password has been compromised, it's highly recommended to change it.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script with the password(s) you want to check as arguments. Example: 

```shell
python password_checker.py mypassword secret123
